There are many set methods, some of which we have already used above. Here is a list of all the methods that are available with the set objects:

add()	Adds an element to the set
clear()	Removes all elements from the set
copy()	Returns a copy of the set
difference()	    Returns the difference of two or more sets as a new set
difference_update()	Removes all elements of another set from this set
discard()	        Removes an element from the set if it is a member. (Do nothing if the element is not in set)
intersection()	    Returns the intersection of two sets as a new set
intersection_update()	Updates the set with the intersection of itself and another
isdisjoint()	    Returns True if two sets have a null intersection
issubset()	        Returns True if another set contains this set
issuperset()	Returns True if this set contains another set
pop()	        Removes and returns an arbitrary set element. Raises KeyError if the set is empty
remove()	    Removes an element from the set. If the element is not a member, raises a KeyError
symmetric_difference()	        Returns the symmetric difference of two sets as a new set
symmetric_difference_update()	Updates a set with the symmetric difference of itself and another
union()	    Returns the union of sets in a new set
